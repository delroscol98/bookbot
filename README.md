# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## What I learned

Bookbot is my first real command-line application in Python that does data analysis on text files, or rather, entire novels like "Frankenstein", "Moby Dick", or "Pride and Prejudice".

### Future Development

As I progress through the Boot.dev course, I want to try and complete all challenges using Neovim with the hopes of:
- Increasing my typing speed
- Knowing my command line more deeply
- Enjoying programming through the lense of the terminal rather than a GUI (...sorry VSCode)

## My Build Process

### 1. Setup

I Setup a local Python development environment, complete with a Git repository

### 2. Data Analysis

I wrote Python functions that analyse data from a novel of text and extrapolate word and character counts

### 3. Report

I built a beautiful analytics report and add command-line tooling to make your application usable with any plain text file
