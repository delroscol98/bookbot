# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## How to use

1. Download all the files from [Github](https://github.com/delroscol98/bookbot)
2. (Assuming you have Python3 installed) From the root file in the terminal type the following command then `<Enter>`

    ```python3 main.py path/plain_txt_file.txt```

3. If the path `path/plain_txt_file.txt` is omitted, an error will occur as the program will not know what text to analyse.

## What I learned

Bookbot is my first real command-line application in Python that does data analysis on text files, or rather, entire novels like "Frankenstein", "Moby Dick", or "Pride and Prejudice".
From an analytical perspective, it was so cool to see how many words are used in these MASSIVE books and the number of times a character is repeated.

(Spoiler alert: "e" is repeated the most across the board, followed by "t"... so sTrangE)

### Future Development

As I progress through the Boot.dev course, I want to try and complete all challenges using Neovim with the hopes of:
- Increasing my typing speed
- Knowing my command line more deeply
- Enjoying programming through the lense of the terminal rather than a GUI (...sorry VSCode)

## My Build Process

### 1. Setup

I Setup a local Python development environment, complete with a Git repository

### 2. Data Analysis

I wrote Python functions that analyse data from a novel of text and extrapolate word and character counts

### 3. Report

I built a beautiful analytics report and add command-line tooling to make your application usable with any plain text file

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Command Line (zsh)
